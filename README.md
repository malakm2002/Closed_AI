# HIGGS_Classification

## Data Exploration:

Load and explore the dataset. Look at the distribution of each feature to identify potential outliers, anomalies, or data quality issues. Identify any missing or incomplete data and determine how to handle it (e.g., imputation, deletion).

## Data Preparation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Normalize or standardize the features to have a similar scale and to improve model performance. Consider feature selection and engineering techniques to improve the quality and usefulness of the input data.

## Model Selection:

Explore different models that are suitable for classification tasks such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Compare the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Optimization:

Tune hyperparameters to improve the performance of the selected model(s) on the validation set. Consider techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or random search to find the best hyperparameters.

## Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the final model on the test set. Interpret the results and analyze the model's ability to distinguish between signal and background processes.

# Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy the model in a production environment to classify new data.
